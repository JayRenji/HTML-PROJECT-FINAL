				<p>Another of my hobbies is actually my job!</p>
				<p>I Love languages, I like studying them, and learning them and enjoy researching and going back to the root fo words.</p>
				<br />
				<p>
					I speak several languages and enjoy very much teaching professional people across the world ways to better communicate with their colleagues and how
					to express themselves to achieve their objectives.
