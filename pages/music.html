				<h1><u> Music</u></h1>
				<p>
					My second hobby is music. Music holds a special place in my heart, it is with me at all times and wherever I go, I enjoy very much losing myself to
					the melodies and studying the lyrics of my favorite songs.
				</p>
				<br />
				<p>I am also a musician and a singer, I play the guitar and have dones so for many years. <b>IT's WAY CHEAPER THAN THERAPY</b></p>
